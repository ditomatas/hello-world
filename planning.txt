Thinking about projects for the pi.

HUB DISPLAY
- A place to display everything going on in my world. Shopping lists, emails, calendar, reading and writing
  activity. Could synchronize with my Wyze data, get info on sleep habits and exercise. Weather, etc,
  all in one place.

  NEEDS FOR THE HUB:
  - GUI functionality as from tkinter, KIVY, or pygame
  - Possibility of Wyze integration? Search out
  - General ability to query data (e.g. weather services, email server)
  - Rest of data can be stored locally on the pi, or could use a third party service
    to sync with phone or laptop
  - Mechanics of always-on display (best practices, efficiency and machine-friendliness)
